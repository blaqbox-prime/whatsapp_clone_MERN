# Whatsapp Clone - Group Chats

 This is a complete *M.E.R.N* stack chat app. 
 Based on the Whatsapp build by [CleverProgrammer](https://github.com/CleverProgrammers) on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzdQDxzW2Tw&t=11312s).

 ## Slight Twist Here

 I had issues with getting the firebase integration to work so I decided to use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for the user authentication.
 For the Realtime Updates we used [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) wich I found to be a simpler to understand alternative to socket.io which I've used in another project before. Although I could go either way in the future, I'm looking to explore Pusher a little more and see how it works.
